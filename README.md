# Paddy Disease Classification (Deep Learning)
This deep learning project aims to classify paddy diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The project includes:

1. Train-Test Split
* Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

2. Image Preprocessing
* Resize and Rescale: Normalizes image sizes and pixel values for consistent model input.
* Data Augmentation: Applies transformations to the training data to enhance model generalization.

3. Model Training
* CNN Architecture: Builds a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
* Adam Optimizer: Compiles the model using the Adam optimizer for efficient and adaptive learning.
